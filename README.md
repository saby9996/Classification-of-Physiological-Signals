# Classification of Physiological Signals

##Problem Statement
To Classify the Signals from a Chest Worn and a Wrist Worn Wearable into 5 Physiological states of a Human Being namely *Transient, Baseline, Stressed, Amusement and Meditation.*

##Dataset Overview
WESAD, a new publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection. This multimodal dataset features physiological and motion data, recorded from both a wrist- and a chest-worn device, of 15 subjects during a lab study. The following sensor modalities are included: blood volume pulse, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electromyogram, respiration, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration.

##Approach
A 1D Convolution Neural Network was designed for the classification of the physiological signals to the aforementioned states.
